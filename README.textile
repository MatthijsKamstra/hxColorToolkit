h1. hxColorToolkit

A haXe library for color conversion and color scheme generation. 

It is based on "colortoolkit":http://code.google.com/p/colortoolkit/ with lots of bug fixs and enhancements.

h2. Usage

Install it from haxelib: @haxelib install hxColorToolkit@

Most of the time you need to use the @ColorToolkit@ class only, so look at there first.
You can use it with @using hxColorToolkit.ColorToolkit;@, and then code something like @var rgb = 0x112233.toRGB();@.
